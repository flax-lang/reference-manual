	\section{Language Overview}
		\subsection{Description}

			Flax is a statically and strongly typed imperative programming language with C-like syntax. It is written as the author's personal
			replacement for C++, and thus has many similar feature classes, which will be explored in due time.

			Syntax-wise, Flax is, generally speaking, a curly-brace-delimited language, featuring optional semicolons, type inference
			(of the \texttt{auto} variety), and \texttt{name: type} variable declarations.

			\subsubsection{Goals and Features}

				Flax has a few broad goals driving its design:

				\begin{bulletlist}
					& Sane compilation strategy (ie. no header files)
					& Minimal programmer friction
					& No undefined behaviour, strange quirks, or other edge cases
					& Low level systems programming
				\end{bulletlist}

				With those in mind,
